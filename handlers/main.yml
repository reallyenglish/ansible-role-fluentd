  # XXX insert delay between handlers.
  # there is a race in fluentd's signal handling. the following commands
  # reproduce the issue. the expected result is the service is restarted and
  # reloaded. the actual result is, the service terminates
  #
  # # bundle exec kitchen converge without-ca-key-freebsd
  # # bundle exec kitchen login without-ca-key-freebsd
  # # service fluentd restart; service fluentd reload; echo $?
  # Stopping fluentd.
  # Starting fluentd.
  # 0
  # # service fluentd status
  # fluentd is not running.
  # see https://github.com/reallyenglish/ansible-role-fluentd/issues/44
  #
  # XXX two "Wait" handlers must be defined because ansible aggregates multiple
  # calls to a hanlder into one
  #
  # XXX listed order of these handlers does matter. "Wait 3 seconds (restart)"
  # must be defined before "Reload fluentd" handler. otherwise, the former is
  # executed *after* "Reload fluentd" handler, which is not what we wanted. the
  # wait handlers are supposed to be executed between "Restart" and "Reload"
  #
  # http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/glossary.html says:
  # "Handlers are run in the order they are listed, not in the order that they
  # are notified."
